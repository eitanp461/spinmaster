4. Click "Save"
5. In your new app, click "Settings"
6. Copy your **Client ID** (you'll need this next)

## 2. Configure the App

1. Open `src/config/spotify.ts`
2. Replace `'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID'` with your actual Client ID:

```typescript
export const SPOTIFY_CONFIG = {
  CLIENT_ID: 'paste_your_client_id_here', // Replace this line
  // ... rest stays the same
};
```

## 3. Install and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies

npm run dev
```

  // Add more songs...
];
```
